Developed a startup funding prediction model using Kaggle data by performing data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis (histograms, heatmaps, correlations).
Trained multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Random Forest) and selected the best based on RMSE/MAE performance.
Built a complete ML pipeline and applied it to predict Byju’s funding amount, comparing actual vs predicted results for validation.
